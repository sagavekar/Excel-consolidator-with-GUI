# Excel-consolidator-with-GUI
This is a Python program that allows you to consolidate data from multiple Excel and CSV files into a single file. You can select the input files, the sheet number containing the data, and the output file using a graphical user interface (GUI). The program uses the pandas library to read and concatenate the data from the selected files.
